## About This Project

Tabitha was my first real Spring Boot project. Before I even wrote a line of code, I watched a two-hour YouTube tutorial — twice

I learned how to:
- Use Spring Security with JWT.
- Create and use DTOs effectively.
- Handle authentication and authorization.
- Build RESTful APIs for bookmarks.

Thanks to @MoyoJava (Spotify) for the early guidance!

Tabitha now supports:
- Bookmark creation, deletion, and categorization.
- Sharing bookmarks with others.
- A mobile app frontend (in progress).

> 📝 I didn’t document Tabitha the way I’m doing with Awa — but I’m fixing that now.
